# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `hideToolCalls` config option and `/msg-bridge toggletools` command to hide tool call summaries in remote messages
- Empty-message guard in all transports (Discord, Telegram, Slack, WhatsApp) to prevent provider errors on whitespace-only payloads

### Fixed
- `sendUserMessage` crash when a remote message arrives mid-turn — messages are now queued via `{ deliverAs: "steer" }` (fixes #10)
- `pendingRemoteChat` no longer cleared on tool-call-only turns, so the next response reaches the right chat
- Whitespace-only assistant responses no longer trigger Discord's "Cannot send an empty message" error

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- Interactive menu (`/msg-bridge` with no args) — configure, connect, widget, help via `ui.select()`
- Single-instance connection guard to prevent duplicate polling / 409 conflicts (fixes #2)
  - Layer 1: global flag for same-process re-entrant calls (sub-agents)
  - Layer 2: PID lock file (`~/.pi/msg-bridge.lock`) for cross-process duplicates
- Session shutdown handler — releases lock and disconnects transports on exit
- Lock check on `/msg-bridge configure` connect calls to prevent bypassing the guard
- Test suite (vitest): config, lock, and formatting modules
- CI workflow (GitHub Actions: lint + typecheck + test)
- Biome linter configuration

### Fixed
- Discord DM messages not received — added required `Partials.Channel` and `Partials.Message` to client options (fixes #5, thanks @chr15m)
- Transport errors now show clean messages instead of full stack traces

### Changed
- Extracted `config.ts`, `lock.ts`, `formatting.ts`, `ui/main-menu.ts` from index.ts
- Moved `@mariozechner/pi-*` packages to peerDependencies
- Updated devDependencies: typescript ^6.0.2, @types/node ^25.3.0, @biomejs/biome ^2.4.8, vitest ^4.1.1
- `prepublishOnly` now runs lint and typecheck before build
- Applied `npm audit fix` for transitive dependency vulnerabilities

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-11

### Changed
- Package renamed from `pi-msg-bridge` to `pi-messenger-bridge` for better clarity
- Updated all repository URLs and documentation to reflect new package name
- Command remains `/msg-bridge` for brevity and ease of use

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- WhatsApp integration via Baileys library with QR code authentication
- Slack integration with Socket Mode support
- Discord integration with Message Content intent support
- Debug mode for troubleshooting (config.debug or MSG_BRIDGE_DEBUG env var)
- Non-blocking async transport initialization for faster startup
- Widget toggle command (`/msg-bridge widget`)
- Help command with full command reference
- Automatic invalid session cleanup (WhatsApp 401 handling)
- Session detection to prevent QR spam on startup

### Changed
- Renamed from "remote-pilot" to "msg-bridge" throughout codebase
- Command changed from `/remote` to `/msg-bridge`
- Config file moved from `~/.pi/msg-bridge/config.json` to `~/.pi/msg-bridge.json`
- WhatsApp auth directory: `~/.pi/msg-bridge-whatsapp-auth/`
- All debug output now behind debug flag (no spam by default)
- Status widget only shows connected transports
- Environment variables now override config file settings

### Security
- Config file permissions enforced: chmod 600 for files, 700 for directories
- Config directory permissions validated on startup with warnings
- WhatsApp auth directory created with secure permissions (700)
- Invalid WhatsApp sessions automatically cleared on 401 errors

### Fixed
- QR code display for WhatsApp (using qrcode-terminal instead of Baileys built-in)
- Tool call formatting now shows actual parameters instead of speculation
- Username extraction from WhatsApp messages
- Connection state tracking for accurate widget display
- Startup performance (transports load in background)

### Dependencies
- Added: @whiskeysockets/baileys, qrcode-terminal, @slack/bolt, discord.js
- Known vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies (node-telegram-bot-api, discord.js) - low impact for this use case

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- Initial MVP release
- Event-driven architecture using `pi.sendUserMessage()` and `turn_end` events
- Telegram bot integration with polling support

- Status widget showing connection status
- Commands: `/remote`, `/remote connect`, `/remote disconnect`, `/remote configure`
- Environment variable and file-based configuration
- Support for group chats with mention detection
- Channel authorization modes: all, mentions, trusted-only

### Security
- 6-digit challenge codes with 2-minute expiry
